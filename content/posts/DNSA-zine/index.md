This was designed for my Information Services and Resources course. I wanted to create an eye-catching, tangible advertisement for students and researchers at a University for this invaluable trove of government documents.

The [*Digital National Security Archive (DNSA)*](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/digital-national-security-archive) is hosted by ProQuest in collaboration with the National Security Archives at George Washington University.

Given that this zine is intended to inform researchers, it includes information about the ways that the DNSA can be searched and navigated.
