Introduction
The Yale University Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscripts Library purchased the Thomas Thistlewood Papers in 2011. This particular collection had become increasingly popular during the preceding half century while it was stored in the Lincolnshire Archives in the UK. After Yale’s acquisition of this collection, it was minimally processed by Diane Ducharme, a senior archivist working within the Beinecke Library, digitized, and made openly available online via the Yale Library Catalog website. This collection has been framed as one of the most thorough accounts of life in the Commonwealth Caribbean, given the 92 volumes of diaries covering the last half of the 18th century written by Thomas Thistlewood himself (Yale University Library, 2011). At face value, describing this collection as a collection of diaries makes it seem innocuous enough. Further examination of the diaries reveals a historical narrative of grotesque brutality and the realities of the horrors of slavery and plantations in the 18th century. Given the age of this collection, there have been numerous opportunities to re-represent it. The collection itself has changed hands many times and each transaction over the course of 300 years has brought with it some form of new arrangement to be influenced by the understanding of history at the moment. This analysis explores the responsibilities and complexities of how archivists can both ensure broad access to critical primary source material and mitigate the reproduction of violent politics, accurately describe traumatic and violent materials, and acknowledge the power inherent in archival work, libraries, and collections such as the Thomas Thistlewood Papers.">

<h2 id="the-thomas-thistlewood-papers-collection-overview">The Thomas Thistlewood Papers: Collection Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-thomas-thistlewood-papers-collection-overview">#</a></h2>
<p>Thomas Thistlewood was a slave- and plantation-owner from Lincolnshire, England. His diaries, dated between 1748-1786, are incredibly thorough, including depictions of his violent brutal physical and sexual punishment of slaves written in “schoolboy latin”(Gerbner, 2022), notes from his reading, and weather observations. These records were created while living on his plantation, Paradise, which he eventually renamed Breadnut Island (Centre for the Studies of the Legacy of British Slavery, n.d.).</p>
<p>The Thomas Thistlewood Papers collection was purchased by the Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscripts Library with funds from the James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn fund through Sotheby’s of London (Yale University Library, 2011). The collection is roughly 9.5 linear feet as has been entirely digitized and all high-resolution images are openly available online via the Yale University Library website through the Thomas Thistlewood Papers finding aid. The papers have been separated into four distinct series: Diaries, 1748-1786; Weather Journals, 1752-1786; Reading Notes &amp; Other Papers; and Oversized (Yale University Library, 2011). The Oversized category appears to contain materials related to reading notes. Yale University, being a private institution, is not bound by the same financial disclosure requirements that public institutions face. Therefore, it is unknown how much the Thomas Thistlewood Papers were purchased from Sotheby’s of London for, though some speculate that its value lies somewhere in the six-figure range (Gerbner, 2022).</p>
<p>Prior to the purchase of the collection by Yale University, the Lincolnshire Archives was its home. The Baron Monson, William John Monson, deposited the diaries in 1951 but still retained ownership over the contents of the entire Monson Family Papers (Gerbner, 2022). Gerbner points out how this type of agreement fundamentally exploited archival labor for the benefit of wealthy collection owners, yet this agreement also made these collections available to the public for the first time. In the original arrangement of these records, the archivists responsible for processing this collection, Joan Varley and Dorothy Williamson, made choices to categorize the Thistlewood diaries into a Miscellaneous series within the Monson Family Papers due to the bulk of the collection pertaining to local politics and history. Varley and Williamson described this Miscellaneous series as &ldquo;A full and interesting record concerned with life in Jamaica” (Gerbner, 2022). While the work of Varley and Williamson did ultimately help surface these diaries for scholarly research, one might wonder why they made the choice to describe this particular section as such. In their temporal context, this may have been appropriate action to take based on the collecting mission of the Lincolnshire Archives, however, seventy years of professional hindsight has granted us the ability to understand how these archivists could have approached this collection differently.</p>
<p>Roughly around the same time the Baron Monson deposited his family’s records in the Lincolnshire Archives, Kenneth Ingram was beginning his work as a University Librarian at the University of the West Indies Mona campus in Jamaica (The University of the West Indies, 2007). Around 1970, Kenneth Ingram, in a quest to develop an authoritative record on the history of the Commonwealth Caribbean, developed a thorough bibliography of primary source material related to slavery and imperialism in the Caribbean. Kenneth Ingram’s 1976 publication Sources of Jamaican History 1655–1838: A Bibliographical Survey with Particular Reference to Manuscript Sources was a seminal work that helped to surface the Thistlewood Papers in the collective consciousness. He petitioned the chancellor of the University of the West Indies to request a copy of the Thistlewood diaries to be sent to the University. The chancellor made this request of William John Monson, who agreed and sent a copy to the institution (Gerbner, 2022).</p>
<p>Over the past seventy years the Thomas Thistlewood papers have seen significant use, likely well beyond what the Monson family and the Lincolnshire Archivists anticipated. Thanks to Kenneth Ingram’s work, there have been numerous articles and books written about Thomas Thistlewood, the contents of his diaries, and the global echoes and traces of the violence of the transatlantic slave trade. Prolific works such as In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86 (Hall, 1999); Mastery, Tyranny, and Desire (Burnard, 2004); and Venus in Two Acts (Hartman, 2008) have all been made possible because of the archival labor put into this collection.</p>
<p>Additional archival labor has been conducted in the time since the Thomas Thistlewood Papers changed hands from the Lincolnshire Archives to the Yale University Beinecke Special Collections Library in 2011 as well. As mentioned before, the collection was purchased for an unknown sum of money and once the collection was in the possession of Yale University, it was processed by medievalist and at-the-time senior archivist Diane Ducharme, who retired from her position in 2021 (Yale University Library, 2021). As previously noted, after processing, the entire collection was digitally scanned and made available for free on the internet (Yale University Library, 2015).</p>
<h2 id="critical-archives-and-the-archival-turn">Critical Archives and the Archival Turn<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#critical-archives-and-the-archival-turn">#</a></h2>
<p>For a vast majority of the history of archives in Western society, there has been a collective (mis)understanding of their function and power in the world. It was not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that critical scholarship examined the ways that archives construct, maintain, and replicate power structures in society by shaping and preserving cultural and social memory. One of the most influential pieces of archival science scholarship about the power of archives and archivists came from Joan Schwartz and Terry Cook in 2002 with their paper Archives, Records, and Power: The Making of Modern Memory, published in Archival Science. This work offered a critique of the philosophical Archival Turn that was being explored by literary and humanities scholars outside of the archival profession and the feigned neutrality of archivists within the profession.</p>
<p>The Archival Turn movement in critical theory scholarship surfaced the ways in which assumptions about archives obfuscate this power and perpetuate narratives about the neutrality of archives, archivists, and their collections. While this intellectual movement was not necessarily perfect in its understanding of archives in a literal, functional sense, it did signal a redevelopment of the understanding of how history and social memory perpetuates culture, violence, and power beyond those working in archives (Schwartz &amp; Cook, 2002).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this school of thought was gaining momentum as the Thomas Thistlewood Papers was becoming progressively more well-known thanks to works like Thomas Hall’s In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86 (1999). One of the most prolific and well-known examples of this critical examination of the power of archives comes from Saidiya Hartman’s Venus in Two Acts (2008). In her work, Hartman examines the ways in which archives fail to account for the silences they create, particularly for Black people due to the violence of Trans-Atlantic slavery, utilizing the case of the Thomas Thistlewood Papers. Much, if not most of the criticism of the treatment of the Thomas Thistlewood Papers comes from outside of the archival science profession in the form of literary criticism, historical analysis, or critical cultural studies. As of the time of this writing, a broad search through the Society of American Archivists journal The American Archivist with the term “Thistlewood” yields no results pertaining to the collection, only a single author who shares the last name. A search through the University of Michigan Library system catalog for “Thistlewood + Archives” returns one result: Thomas Thistlewood’s Libidinal Linnaean Project: Slavery, Ecology, and Knowledge Production by Heather Vermeulen (2018). Like many others, Vermeulen’s article is more of a critical analysis of the historical significance of the documentation of Thomas Thistlewood than a critique of the archival labor and decisions involved in making his documents accessible.</p>
<h2 id="the-politics-and-ethics-of-archival-violence-and-repair">The Politics and Ethics of Archival Violence and Repair<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-politics-and-ethics-of-archival-violence-and-repair">#</a></h2>
<p>The dearth of scholarship surrounding the treatment of this particular collection is troubling in light of how frequently this collection is used in critical humanities and history scholarship. In spite of this, the ethical dilemmas surrounding this collection and the violence imprinted within it should still be explored. What responsibilities and imperatives do archivists have to wield their power to heal and repair historical violence and how can archivists go about achieving this? Utilizing the Core Values and Ethics of the Society of American Archivists as a framework, these dilemmas seem to lie at the intersection of the principles and values of judgment, responsible stewardship, social responsibility, and accountability.</p>
<h3 id="judgment--responsible-stewardship">Judgment &amp; Responsible Stewardship<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#judgment--responsible-stewardship">#</a></h3>
<p>The Society of American Archivists Code of Ethics states that “Archivists should be transparent about their role in the selection, retention, and creation of the historical record by carefully documenting all collections-related policy decisions, including preservation treatments, descriptive work, processing activities, and access guidelines” (Society of American Archivists, 2020). For many archivists and cultural memory institutions, the work of documenting judgment comes in the form of processing notes in finding aids. The 1950-1951 Archivists’ Report from the Lincolnshire Archives Committee describes the nature of the deposit made by William John Monson in 1951, but notes that the collection will not be processed until some point in the future when capacity would allow the work to happen (Lincolnshire Archives Committee, 1951). Subsequent editions of the Archivists’ Report do not necessarily describe the nature of the processing that occurred, only the findings resulting from going through each collection. Gerbner was able to find a reference to Thomas Thistlewood’s diaries in some sort of reference guide written by Joan Varley and Dorothy Williamson, which described the diaries as “a full and interesting record” and “concerning life in Jamaica” (2022). It is fundamentally impossible to know whether or not Joan Varley’s and Dorothy Williamson’s description of this collection would be understood as pertaining to the brutality of slavery and Thistlewood’s treatment of humans held in bondage. According to Gerbner, these diaries were not accessed as frequently as the Monson collection holdings pertaining to other topics and perhaps were not described in more detail, and obviously the standards for transparency and documentation of collections decisions are not universally decided and have changed over time. However, it certainly could have been possible that processing notes were maintained by the Lincolnshire Archives prior to the purchase of the Thistlewood diaries by Yale University. Regardless, a choice was made to not address or acknowledge the power and violence of this portion of the collection in spite of a growing body of critical literature in the years since it was originally described.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the choices made by Diane Ducharme while processing the Thistlewood Papers in 2011. The finding aid for the Thomas Thistlewood Papers in the Yale University Library online catalog notes that “This collection received a basic level of processing, including housing and minimal organization” (2011). The finding aid also states that “The 92 volumes of the Thistlewood Papers were arranged and numbered in the nineteenth century while in the possession of William John Monson, Baron Monson, and this order has been preserved in this finding aid” (Yale University Library, 2011). The processing note in the finding aid appears to be very typical according to standards like DACS (Society of American Archivists, 2022) and there appears to be a concerted effort to add value to the finding aid by naming this basic custodial history mentioned above. However, regardless of whether the original order of William John Monson was maintained and simple rehousing occurred or not, additional information pertaining to the reasoning behind these choices would help to increase the transparency around archival labor. This would serve to surface the labor involved, as well as provide helpful context for those conducting research with the collection by helping them understand the ways that the collection has been re-represented. By creating a supplemental notes document or providing more robust information in the existing finding aid structure, Archivists can create mechanisms for accountability and the responsible use of archival power.</p>
<h3 id="social-responsibility">Social Responsibility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-responsibility">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the core values of the Society of American Archivists names an imperative to commit to  “making ethical and transparent decisions about how to provide care for the documents, records, and materials entrusted to them” (Society of American Archivists, 2020). The fact that the Thomas Thistlewood Papers were purchased via private sale by a private institution seems to sidestep this principle. As mentioned previously, this collection plays a significant role in understanding the legacy of slavery in various parts of the world. Keeping the sale price of these diaries secret only serves the purchaser, seller, and beneficiary - it does nothing to acknowledge the violence of slavery and, in fact, only perpetuates structures of white supremacy. Yale, as a private institution, has no obligation to disclose this information but there is speculation that the price was in the six-figure range (Gerbner, 2022). This sale benefits a very wealthy institution - Yale, a very wealthy business - Sotheby’s of London, which made $7.9 billion in sales in 2023 (Shaw, 2024), and a family that has benefitted from intergenerational wealth procured through the violence of slavery - the Monsons. Gerbner surfaces the problematic nature of this collection being accessible only to the wealthiest of institutions, and while it should be noted that this collection was made available in a digitized form in 2015 thanks to the work of the Beinecke Library staff, why should an institution like Yale be able purchase it but not a university in Jamaica (Yale University Library, 2015; Gerbner, 2022)? Yes, the influence of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade does have significant impact on the culture and history of the United States, but it is curious as to why this collection is here. Yale clearly has the resources to manage the physical preservation needs of this 300 year old collection, but surely other institutions do as well?</p>
<p>Keeping the Thomas Thistlewood Papers in the United States divorces access to collective history from a group of people and perpetuates the Othering of racism. Similarly to the issues of transparency in the description and representation of the Thistlewood Papers in Ducharme’s finding aid, additional transparency from the curators and library administrators would be helpful since there is no record of the decision making process that informed the purchase of this collection.</p>
<h2 id="building-bridges">Building Bridges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#building-bridges">#</a></h2>
<p>There will be no perfect solution, no magic bullet to find the best way to approach the legacy of the harm inflicted by Thomas Thistlewood or the institutions his cruelty benefitted. The lives forgotten or de-saturated and flattened by the records of slavery cannot be recovered and humanity must live with this reality. This does not mean that work should not be done to share the records of the most horrific parts of the past, but rather the contrary. Part of ethically engaging with these records means acknowledging these parts of history, and sharing both the responsibility and benefits of preserving them. As of 2024, an application for the UNESCO Memory of the World Register was submitted to have the Thomas Thistlewood Papers added as a part of efforts to make the documentary heritage of the world accessible to all (UNESCO, n.d.). This application was a collaborative effort, submitted by Barbara Rockenbach, University Librarian of Yale University and Dr. Paulette Kerr, Campus Librarian of the University of the West Indies Mona Campus. This is a small step in a better direction. The application itself does not solely describe the brutality of Thistlewood, but also the resilience and practices of those living under such violent and oppressive systems. Additionally, both Rokenbach and Kerr name other uses for the information contained in the diaries, including research on climate change (Rockenbach &amp; Kerr, 2024). This acknowledgement and this partnership is significant, considering the historical relationship that the University of the West Indies Mona Campus has with the Thomas Thistlewood Papers. As mentioned previously, Kenneth Ingram, who played a significant role in the knowledge of the collection’s existence was also the Campus Librarian for the University of the West Indies Mona Campus. The work of navigating and representing the past in an ethical manner is long, arduous, but certainly necessary.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Undoing the legacy of racism, white supremacy, and colonialism in archives requires that archivists engage beyond the most basics of ethical practice. This work requires that we move beyond what is required for preserving documents and records, but working toward what is just for people and communities. Archivists cannot claim to be stewards of collective memory if ethical standards and responsibilities for preservation and transparency only pertain to documents, not people. Archivists cannot only critique power through their work, they must take up their power to help heal and rectify the violence of the past by clearly communicating the choices they make and the reasons behind them. Some may worry about the impact these choices may have on the status and prestige of their collections and institutions, but if the profession is allegedly moving toward a model of collaboration then this choice only aids the mission. By sharing the responsibilities of stewardship, archivists are able to build strong, collaborative relationships that can not only advance the profession, but also the understanding of shared collective memory.</p>
